    <p>
    Lady Jane Grey was an English noblewoman who was declared queen of England on July 10, 1553. Her reign lasted only nine days before she was deposed by Mary I.
        A highly educated and devout Protestant, Jane was a political pawn used by powerful nobles in a dangerous game of succession. 
        Despite her brief rule, her tragic story and execution at age 16 left a lasting mark on English history.
